<br>

Core design tenants: <br>
1. Use E-waste as much as possible <br>
2. Substantially reduce noise to allow for 24/7 operation in homes / workspaces <br>
4. Improve aesthetics, no tape etc, 3d printed parts <br>
5. Printed parts should be easy to print and not require supports <br>
6. Target cost below original Corsi-Rosenthol design <br>
7. Servicable with easily replacable filters <br>
8. Use filters that are often discounted and readily available (20x20x1) <br>

<br>

It is suggested to make the corner clips out of PETG as they are a snap-fit. <br>

2. 4x 120mm PC Fans <br>
These are easily scavenged from old PCs. If you cant find 120mm, you can easily adapt this design, or use an existing adapter such as this: <br>

Printing notes: <br>

All parts will fit on a prusa printer.. or any printer with a 250mm wide bed. <br>

<br>
Any infill is fine for the panels, but for the clips it is good to use at least 3 walls. <br>
Each panel is about 100g of material, the project target was to be completed within one spool and this is easily achievable with normal print settings. <br>
<br>

General notes: <br>
The air guides on the fans are not required. They do improve noise and prevent recirculation however for a better overall system efficiency. <br>
Step files are provided if you want to modify the design.<br>
Expect around 200-400CFM with a merv 13 filter depending on the fans you have sourced.
